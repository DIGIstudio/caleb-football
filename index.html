                You have heard it before you need a pitch? How else can I practice my sick skills bro? But this programme suits those wherever you are. No matter how big or small your backyard is there is always a chance to play some sort of football game. Size doesn’t matter. The Backyard Football programmes caters so that everyone has a chance to play football no matter where they are. Use your creativity to create games that suit the size of what you have. Make it work with your backyard. How this programme was birthed was because of my brother I wanted to play football outside without the restrictions of our backyards. From that games were created that have been built on to become what they are today. This programme is not made to be followed exactly. It is up to you to create the games that you want to play. Be creative with your space. Everywhere is your pitch.

            <h1 class="title-block">COMPETE WITH FRIENDS</h1>
            <p class="text-block white-text">
                Develop friends. Get better. This is all part of the programme. The core principal of this programme is to build friendships and compete against those friends. The Journey is a part of this programme that makes each game that you play with any number of friends to have large consequences to the overall scheme of your Backyard Football Programme Journey. Winning margins matter and each game won or lost will have a large impact on your Journey to be the best out of your friends. The Journey is a ‘career mode’ that you are not playing on a console or PC of any kind. You are playing football outside to become the best you can. You are not playing by yourself either, you have the chance to prove to your friends that you are the best. The opportunity for greatness is yours. Seize it.
